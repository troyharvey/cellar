# Cellar
An app for sharing your favorite Homebrew formulae. I gave a talk about making this app for [Laravel Louisville](http://laravel-louisville.github.io/meetup) on Febrary 19th, 2014. The slides are on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/troyharvey/your-first-laravel-app) and included [here as a pdf](http://troyharvey.github.io/cellar/deck.pdf).
